>### Note : The following commands are with respect to the write in vscode and execute it in vscode  and i run it on ubuntu

<br/>

>### I have been used sprintf and write function to get the output on the terminal and i also used write function to write the content to the output file. Assignment directory is created to save output files coming from the below programs

<br/>

# **Question-1**

**Name of the file : q1.c**

> ## Command to execute file

``` bash
$ gcc q1.c
$ ./a.out inputfilepath
```

> Progress prints on the terminal and output is new file


```
input filepath is the input file 

output is stored in Assignment directory created in the program and saves with the name 1_filename.txt
```

<br/>


# **Question-2**

**Name of the file : q2.c**

> ### Command to execute file

</br>

```bash
$ gcc q2.c
$ ./a.out filename.txt index1 index2
``` 
</br>

> Progress prints on the terminal and output is new reversed file

</br>

```
inputfilepath is the input file 

output is stored in Assignment directory created in the program and saves with the name 2_filename.txt

we don't need to change the content between index1 and index2
```

<br/>

# **Question-3**

**Name of the file : q2.c**


> ### Command to execute file

</br>

```
$ gcc q3.c
$ ./a.out newfile oldfile Directory
```
</br>

> Output is printed on terminal


</br>

```
newfile is the path of the reversed file

oldfile is the path of the old file(like our input file in q1 and q2)

Directory is the directory created in q1 and q2
```
